# Description of the project

The project consists of a Timetracker application (whose name is Timemanger). In this application you can create and manage projects and then assign tasks that have a content (text) and a time assigned to them. The user is allowed to create projects, and assign members to them as well as a name.

Then the user is allowed to create tasks related to the project he has created or been assigned to. Once the task has been created the user can also edit it.

If the user has the rol of the manager of the project he can also modify the project name and members by deactivating the project for them as well as overlooking all the tasks inserted to a project.

The user is required to register and later login to use any of the web's features.

## Reason of the project

Due to the increase of working from home because of the pandemic, the need for this type of applications has been increased as companie need to manage their workers hours and do not have tools like this to do so.I thought that this project was a wonderful opportunity to create it.

There are many aspects to improve (look, funcionality,security... ) and I will continue to work on it as a side project.
